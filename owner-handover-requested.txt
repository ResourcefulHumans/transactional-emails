# Build the Gamma Cannon

Priority: gold
Done:     no
Pending:  no

I need your help to build the Gamma Cannon so we can stop Whitney Frost!

Once it's build we need to

- Test it (we might skip that…)
- Fire it at Whitney!

## Tasks (4)

[x] Bring the prototype to the lab
[ ] Finish the construction
[ ] Test it
[ ] Fire it at Whitney Frost!
